## What is Bionic Reading?
Bionic reading is a method to improve reading efficiency by making the first half of each letter in a sentence **bold**.
This same sentence is presented in bionic reading as:
**Bio**nic **read**ing **i**s **a** **met**hod **t**o **impr**ove **read**ing **effic**iency **b**y **mak**ing **th**e **fir**st **ha**lf **o**f **ea**ch **let**ter **i**n **a** **sent**ence **bo**ld.

## How does it work?
As the optimal viewing position effect suggests, the optimal position for our eyes to land is the left half of a word (Clark & O'Regan, 1999). Bionic reading utilizes this characteristic of reading and mark the first half of words bold to help the reader to land on the optimal viewing position in eye movements (Snell, 2024).

## Does it work?
Some studies suggests that this method improves reading abilities of students (Ariyani, 2023) while others does not find any difference in reading time between bionic reading and traditional reading (Snell, 2024). **I will not question the effect of this method here, but rather provide a tool to convert text into bionic reading formatting.**
